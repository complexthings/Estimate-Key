```

Change to project root and run

``` bash
(unix)      $ framework/sake seed flush=1
(windows)   > php framework/cli-script.php seed flush=1
```

```

`--force`|run the seeder ignoring current records
`--key`|only (un)seed records matching this key
`--class`|only seed records for this root class

## Providers

Providers are a simple way to customise what data is generated. The seeder comes with a bunch of useful providers

Provider | Description | Example
-------- | ----------- | -------
ValueProvider | Use the given value, select variables included | `Field: 'this is the value'`
DateProvider | Generate a date | `Field: date(+3 months)`
FakerProvider | Generate data using the php faker library | `Field: faker(sentences,3)`
FirstObjectProvider | Returns the first instance of the class | `Parent: first(Page)`
RandomObjectProvider | Returns a list of random objects for class | `Children: random(Page)`
HTMLProvider | Returns random HTML | `Field: html()`
ImageProvider | Returns an `Image` of a [placehold.it](http://placehold.it) image | `Image: image(300,400)`
MemberProvider | Returns a member with email and password | `Member: member(test@test.com,password)`
WhereProvider | Returns a DataObject with matching field value | `Parent: where(Page, URLSegment, i-am-a-parent)`
